# Technocrane Tools
Tools that help to emulate data packets or analyze incoming packets data

## Data Display

 This is a tiny COM trace application that could help to see what data is receving on a specified com port.

Usage example from command line
datadisplay.exe -d COM1

## Data Generator

 This is a console application that could be used to stream generated or source file data packets.

Usage example to stream packets from *.cgi file
datagenerator.exe --open "D:\\Work\\Technocrane\\Result\\test-cgi.cgi" --timecode
